# Common Issues in AI Rules Files

Use this resource for detailed diagnostic patterns and fixes for common rules file problems.

## Critical Issues

### 1. File Too Large

**Symptoms:**

- AI ignores some rules
- Inconsistent code generation
- AI seems to "forget" instructions

**Detection:** Check line count and character count of each file.

**Thresholds:**

- **Critical**: > 200 lines or > 6,000 characters
- **Warning**: 150-200 lines or 5,000-6,000 characters

**Impact:** Large files consume AI context window, leaving less room for understanding your actual code. The AI may ignore rules that appear later in the file.

**Fix:** Split into multiple focused files:

```
# Before: .builderrules (400 lines)

# After:
.builderrules (100 lines - core conventions)
.builder/rules/component-structure.mdc (80 lines)
.builder/rules/testing-standards.mdc (70 lines)
.builder/rules/api-patterns.mdc (80 lines)
.builder/rules/styling-guidelines.mdc (70 lines)
```

### 2. Too Many `alwaysApply` Rules

**Symptoms:**

- AI performance degradation
- Rules contradicting each other
- Context window exhaustion

**Detection:** Count files in `.builder/rules/` with `alwaysApply: true` in frontmatter.

**Threshold:** Maximum 3-5 files with `alwaysApply: true`

**Impact:** Every `alwaysApply: true` file is loaded for every request, consuming context that could be used for code understanding.

**Fix:** Convert to glob-scoped rules:

```yaml
# Before - applies to everything
---
description: Component rules
alwaysApply: true
---
# After - scoped to relevant files only
---
description: Component rules
alwaysApply: false
globs:
  - "src/components/**/*.tsx"
  - "src/app/**/components/**/*.tsx"
---
```

---

### 3. Missing Frontmatter _(`.mdc` files only)_

> **Note:** `agents.md` does not require frontmatter. This issue applies only to `.builder/rules/*.mdc` files.

**Symptoms:**

- Rules not being applied correctly
- No scoping of rules
- Missing context for AI

**Detection:** Check if `.mdc` files start with `---` frontmatter block. Do not flag `agents.md` for missing frontmatter.

**Impact:** Without frontmatter, the AI doesn't know when to apply rules or what they're for.

**Fix:** Add proper frontmatter to every `.mdc` file:

```yaml
---
description: Clear, concise description of rule purpose
globs:
  - "pattern/to/match/**/*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---
```

---

### 4. Missing `description` Field

**Symptoms:**

- Unclear rule purpose
- Difficulty maintaining rules
- AI may misapply rules

**Detection:** Check frontmatter for `description:` field.

**Impact:** Both humans and AI need context about what each rule file covers.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# Before
---
globs:
  - "**/*.tsx"
---
# After
---
description: React component structure and organization patterns
globs:
  - "**/*.tsx"
---
```

---

### 5. Wrong File Naming

**Symptoms:**

- Rules not being detected
- Configuration errors
- Silent failures

**Detection:** Look for common naming mistakes.

**Common mistakes:**

| Wrong                   | Correct                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `.builderrule`          | `.builderrules`          |
| `.builder/rules/foo.md` | `.builder/rules/foo.mdc` |

> **Note:** `AGENTS.md` and `agents.md` are both valid — agents file matching is case-insensitive.

**Fix:** Rename files to match conventions exactly.

---

## High Priority Issues

### 6. Agent-Rules Content in Plain `.md` Files

**Symptoms:**

- AI ignores project conventions despite documentation existing
- Rules are written but not picked up by the rules system
- Project has `AGENTS.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `SCAFFOLDING_CHECKLIST.md`, or similar files at the root

**Detection:** Scan all `.md` files for name/content signals (see SKILL.md "Detecting Agent-Rules .md Files"). Flag files that look like they're instructing the AI rather than documenting for humans.

**Impact:** Plain `.md` files are not guaranteed to be loaded by the rules system. Content may be ignored entirely, or loaded inconsistently. Even when loaded (e.g., `AGENTS.md` in some tools), the file lacks scoping — all rules apply to all files, wasting context.

**Fix:** Migrate to `.builder/rules/*.mdc` with proper frontmatter and glob scoping:

```yaml
# Before: CODING_STANDARDS.md (plain markdown, no scoping)

# After: .builder/rules/component-standards.mdc
---
description: Component structure and naming conventions
globs:
  - "src/components/**/*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---
## Component Rules
- Place in `src/components/{feature}/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Export named + default from index.ts
```

**Migration steps:**

1. Identify the domains covered by the `.md` file (components, API, styling, etc.)
2. Create one `.mdc` file per domain in `.builder/rules/`
3. Add frontmatter with `description` and `globs` scoped to relevant files
4. Copy only the project-specific rules (see Content Minimization Principle)
5. Delete or repurpose the original `.md` file as human-only documentation

---

### 7. Rules Contain Only Generic Advice

**Symptoms:**

- Rules file is large but AI still generates inconsistent code
- Rules say things like "write clean code", "follow best practices", "use meaningful names"
- Rules explain how the language/framework works rather than project specifics

**Detection:** Review each rule. Ask: "Would this appear in a generic blog post or framework docs?" If yes, it's generic and should be cut.

**Examples of generic rules to cut:**

```markdown
# Generic — agent already knows this, cut it:

- Use functional components in React
- Handle errors with try/catch
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow DRY principles
- Write unit tests for your code
- Use meaningful variable names
```

**Examples of specific rules to keep:**

```markdown
# Specific — agent needs this, keep it:

- Components go in `src/features/{feature}/components/{Name}/`
- Always create a `.types.ts` file alongside each component
- Export from the barrel at `src/components/index.ts`
- Reuse existing `useAuth` hook — don't duplicate auth state logic
- Color tokens defined in `src/styles/tokens.css` — never hardcode hex values
```

**Impact:** Generic rules consume context budget without adding value. They can also give AI false confidence it's following project conventions when it's actually ignoring the specifics.

**Fix:** For each rule, ask "does the AI need to be told this, or does it know it from training data?" Cut everything the agent would do by default. Keep only what's project-specific, non-obvious, or overrides a default behavior.

---

### 9. Vague Rules

**Symptoms:**

- Inconsistent code generation
- AI interprets rules differently each time
- Generated code doesn't match expectations

**Detection:** Look for patterns like:

- "Write good code"
- "Follow best practices"
- "Use clean architecture"
- "Be consistent"

**Impact:** Vague rules give AI no actionable guidance. The AI must guess what you mean, leading to inconsistent results.

**Fix:** Make specific and actionable:

```markdown
# Before - vague

Write clean, maintainable code.
Follow best practices for React.
Use good naming conventions.

# After - specific

## Component Structure

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Define props interface above component
- Export component as default export
- Use named exports for types and utilities

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with use prefix (`useAuth.ts`)
- Utils: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)
```

---

### 10. Verbose Rules

**Symptoms:**

- File exceeds size limits
- Key rules buried in prose
- AI may skip important points

**Detection:**

- Paragraphs instead of bullets
- Rules embedded in explanatory text
- Multiple sentences per rule

**Impact:** Verbose text wastes context space and makes rules harder for AI to parse.

**Fix:**

```markdown
# Before - verbose

When you are creating a new component, you should always make sure
that you are following the team's established patterns for component
creation, which includes making sure that the component is placed in
the correct directory structure, uses the proper naming conventions,
and follows all of the styling guidelines that have been established
by the team over the course of the project's development.

# After - concise

New components:

- Place in `src/components/{feature}/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Follow established styling guidelines
```

---

### 11. Conflicting Rules

**Symptoms:**

- AI produces contradictory code
- Inconsistent patterns across generations
- AI seems "confused"

**Detection:** Review for conflicts like:

- Different naming conventions in different files
- Contradictory tech stack declarations
- Overlapping but inconsistent globs

**Example conflicts:**

```markdown
# In .builderrules

Use named exports for all components.

# In component-structure.mdc

Export components as default export.
```

**Fix:**

1. Review all rules files for consistency
2. Establish single source of truth for each concern
3. Use more specific globs to separate concerns
4. Document precedence if intentional overrides exist

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 12. No Code Examples

**Symptoms:**

- AI interprets patterns differently
- Structural conventions not followed
- Format inconsistencies

**Detection:** Check if rule files contain code blocks.

**Impact:** Examples provide unambiguous reference. Without them, AI must guess at implementation details.

**Fix:**

```markdown
# Before - no example

Components should have prop validation using TypeScript interfaces.

# After - with example

Components should have prop validation using TypeScript interfaces:

\`\`\`typescript
interface UserCardProps {
user: User;
onSelect?: (userId: string) => void;
}

export function UserCard({ user, onSelect }: UserCardProps) {
// ...
}
\`\`\`
```

---

### 13. Overly Broad Globs

**Symptoms:**

- Rules applied to wrong files
- Unnecessary context consumption
- Conflicting rules on same files

**Detection:**

```yaml
# Too broad
globs:
  - "**/*"
  - "**/*.ts"

# Better - scoped
globs:
  - "src/components/**/*.tsx"
```

**Fix:** Make globs as specific as possible:

- Target specific directories
- Target specific file extensions
- Exclude test files if not relevant
- Exclude generated files

---

### 14. Duplicate Information

**Symptoms:**

- Same rules in multiple files
- Inconsistency when one copy is updated
- Wasted context space

**Detection:** Compare content across files for duplicates.

**Impact:** Duplication wastes context and creates maintenance burden. Updates may miss copies.

**Fix:**

1. Identify duplicate content
2. Keep in most appropriate location
3. Remove from other locations
4. If needed in multiple contexts, reference rather than duplicate
